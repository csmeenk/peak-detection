Automatic Peak Detection of Local Maxima

This tutorial illustrates a method for peak detection of quasi-periodic signals. We show examples using synthetic data, astronomical data on sunspot activity, and lab data on EUV spectra from high-harmonic generation.

Method
Imagine you have a 1-D signal yi sampled at locations xi (i=1,2,...,N). The goal is to find the values xi where the signal is a local maximum. To do this we use a sliding window method. A window of size 2k slides along the data vector. The value yi is considered a local maximum iff xi-1 > xi-k-1 and xi-1 > xi+k-1. This process is repeated for all window sizes k=1,2,...,N/2-1 .

The python code for executing is provided here.
Dependencies:
python 2.7 or newer
